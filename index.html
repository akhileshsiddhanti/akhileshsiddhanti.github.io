        <span class="about">About</span>
        <hr><br>
        <p> I am currently pursuing <b>Masters of Science in Computer Science</b> at <b>Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta</b>.
        I completed B.E.(Hons.) Computer Science and M.Sc. (Hons.) Mathematics from 
        Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) Pilani K. K. Birla Goa Campus in May 2019.</p>
            
        <p>During my undergraduate days, I have worked in the area of Cryptography, specifically in the area of stream ciphers. During 
        the summers, I interned at Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata and Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore
        on various fault and side-channel attacks and Time-Memory-Data Tradeoff Attacks on lightweight stream and block ciphers. This has resulted in
        several publications in leading conferences and journals.
